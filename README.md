# Generative AI for a smart global disease dashboard demo developed as part of the No.10 Generative AI Hackathon 2024

The problem we tackled was detecting, monitoring, and briefing ministers on any potential emerging biological threats. Our solution, initially focused on flu, consolidated global information, and presented it in three distinct ways. Firstly, a weekly summary grounded in trusted resources is produced using retrieval-augmented generation and an LLM. Secondly through the NewsCatcher API, entity extraction, and sentiment analysis, daily insights are provided. Finally, we use the reasoning abilities of foundational models to compare the weekly and daily summaries to historical data and analyse if any potential biothreats are emerging. By collating numerous trusted sources, extracting key figures, and providing analysis, our solution provides a unique and comprehensive view on emerging biothreats for key decision makers.
